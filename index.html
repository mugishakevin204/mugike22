      Welcome to the official dashboard of the Past Paper Exam Website, your
      trusted online platform designed to make exam preparation smarter and
      easier. Our mission is to support students, teachers, and schools across
      Rwanda by providing quick and organized access to past national
      examination papers for Primary 6 (P6), Senior 3 (S3), and Senior 6 (S6).
      Through this digital platform, learners can browse, preview, and download
      authentic past exam papers to help them revise efficiently and understand
      the real format of national exams. Education is the foundation of success,
      and our goal is to make quality study materials accessible to every
      learner regardless of location or school resources. By offering past
      papers in one place, we aim to save students valuable time and encourage
      consistent practice, which is the key to academic excellence. Teachers and
      parents can also use this system to guide learners through structured
      revision sessions, track progress, and identify areas for improvement.
      This platform continues to grow, and soon we will add more features such
      as automatic marking, discussion forums, and access to helpful study tips.
      Together, we believe that with the right tools and dedication, every
      student can achieve outstanding results. Thank you for choosing the Past
      Paper Exam Website — your partner in learning and success.
